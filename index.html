        <h3 id="headline">Here is a timeline of his life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1887 (December 22)</strong> - Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, to a 
                                                    Tamil-speaking Brahmin family.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1892-1897</strong> - Ramanujan attended the Kangayan Primary School in Kumbakonam, where his 
                                        mathematical abilities began to emerge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1898-1904</strong> - Ramanujan studied at Town Higher Secondary School in Kumbakonam. During 
                                        this time, he independently developed his own mathematical ideas and 
                                        started compiling his own theorems and results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong> - Ramanujan was granted a scholarship to attend Government Arts College in 
                                    Kumbakonam. However, he was so focused on mathematics that he neglected 
                                    his other subjects and eventually dropped out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> - Ramanujan began working as a clerk in the Madras Port Trust to support 
                                    himself financially. During his free time, he continued his mathematical 
                                    research and independently discovered many significant results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1910</strong> - Ramanujan sent a letter containing some of his mathematical work to the 
                                    renowned British mathematician, G.H. Hardy, who was initially skeptical 
                                    of its authenticity. However, Hardy recognized Ramanujan's genius and 
                                    invited him to study at the University of Cambridge in England.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1914-1919</strong> - Ramanujan traveled to England and worked closely with Hardy at 
                                    Trinity College, Cambridge. During this period, he published several 
                                    papers and made important contributions to number theory, partition 
                                    theory, and continued fractions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1918</strong> - Ramanujan was awarded the Bachelor of Science degree by research (Ph.D.) 
                                    from Cambridge University for his work on highly composite numbers, 
                                    partitions, and hypergeometric series.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1919</strong> - Due to health issues and homesickness, Ramanujan returned to India and 
                                    continued his mathematical research. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal 
                                    Society of London in recognition of his contributions to mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1920</strong> - Ramanujan was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which severely affected his 
                                    health. Nevertheless, he continued to work on mathematics, despite his 
                                    deteriorating condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1923 (April 26)</strong> - Srinivasa Ramanujan passed away at the age of 32 in Kumbakonam, 
                                    Tamil Nadu, India. His death was a significant loss to the mathematical 
                                    community.
